# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of Project
### This project is to provide an analysis of PyBer ride-sharing data.

## Purpose
### Using Jupyter notebook, pandas, and matplotlib; I created dataframes and visualizations to provide analysis of the provided data files. The data provided on cities, types of cities, numbers of drivers, and fares was used to produce visualizations of ride-share access and affordablity that will help determine future business decisions.


## Results

#### * There is an inverse relationship between total rides and fares as well as between total drivers and fares.

#### * Urban communities pay the least for their service but make the most money for the company

## PyBer Analysis Summary
#### Based on the data analysis, it is clear that there is the most opportunity in the rural communities.  First, I recommend an outreach campaing to the rural communities to try to get more rides in those cities.  Second, I would recommend having more drivers available in those cities.  Third, I would recommend making the fares more in line with the suburban communities, in hopes that more equitable rates will garner more ridership.
